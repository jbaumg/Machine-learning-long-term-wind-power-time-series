# Machine-learning-long-term-wind-power-time-series

This repository contains the code necessary to generate and validate machine-learning based synthetic time series of nationally aggregated wind power generation for Germany. Further information can be found in the full article "Less Information, Similar Performance: Comparing Machine Learning-Based Time Series of Wind Power Generation to Renewables.ninja" published in Energies (ISSN 1996-1073; CODEN: ENERGA) and in the preprint published on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09426).
Results are provided for download at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3784661

The file "MLWTS_whole script.R" contains the main code for generating wind power time series and the files “MLWTS_validation.R” and “MLWTS_appendixvalidation.R” provide code for the validation and visualization of results.
